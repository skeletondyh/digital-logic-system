A binary coded decimal (BCD) is a serial digital counter that counts
ten digits. And it resets for every new clock input. As it can go 
through 10 unique combinations of output, it is also called as 
 Decade counter . A BCD counter can count 0000, 0001, 0010, 
1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1110, 1111, 0000, and 0001 and so on.
