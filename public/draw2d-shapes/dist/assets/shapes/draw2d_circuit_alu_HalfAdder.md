# Half Adder

Half adder is a combinational logic circuit with two 
inputs and two outputs. 

The half adder circuit is designed to add two single 
bit binary number `A` and `B`. 

It is the basic building block for addition of two 
single bit numbers. This circuit has two outputs 
`carry` and `sum`.


|  A    |    B    |     S    |    C   |
|:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------|
|   0   |    0    |     0    |     0  |
|   0   |    1    |     1    |     0  |
|   1   |    0    |     1    |     0  |
|   1   |    1    |     0    |     1  |
